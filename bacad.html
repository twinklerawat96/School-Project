                <span>To support our students with special needs, we have an inclusive setup in school.<BR/>
                     We also have an Early Intervention as well as a Child Development centre in school wherein we provide stimulation to our students right from the pre-school level uptill class XII.<BR/>
                    We render these services through an occupational therapist and a special educator who assist these students in their day to day functioning as well as their academics.<BR/>
                    Gone are the days when going to a Psychologist was a taboo. <BR/>
                    The need of the hour is early screening, early identification and then providing the child with early stimulation. <BR/>
                    Parental awareness is also generated. They are also counseled and motivated to come out of their denial phase and let the actual work be done with the child.</span>
        
                    <hr style="border:3px solid black;"/><h2>COUNSELLING AND GUIDANCE CENTRE :</h2><hr/>
        <span>“If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavours to live the life which he has imagined,
             he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours”<BR/>
            Counseling is an integral part of an overall program of guidance. <BR/>
            The student life is getting complex day by day. Guidance and counseling is needed to help the students for optimum achievement and <BR/>
            adequate adjustment in the varied life situations. It aids students in enhancing their personality development,<BR/>
            thereby aiming at their wholistic development.
            <BR/>
            Regular workshops are conducted for parents, students as well as the teachers on the various issues of concern and they are encouraged to come up with their individual problems.
            <BR/>
            Modules according to the different age groups are shown to the students on the various topics, followed by brainstorming and detailed discussions.
            <BR/>
            Group therapy as well as individual therapy sessions are being provided to the students as per their requirements.
            <BR/>
            Classroom observations are made as well as regular interaction with the teachers and parents is done so as to streamline the process of guidance and counseling and increase its efficacy.</span>
